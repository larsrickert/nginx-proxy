# JFrog Artifactory

This example creates a self-hosted JFrog Artifactory which can e.g. be used as registry for Maven, npm and more.

::: warning Make the example your own
In general you don't have to change anything in the below example to make it work for you. However, we highly recommend to take a closer look to the lines marked with a `TODO: CHANGE ME` comment.

## Installation

### Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  artifactory:
    image: docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:7.63.14
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./artifactory:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "${DOMAIN?:}"
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "${DOMAIN?:}"
      VIRTUAL_PORT: 8082

  # Proxy service for redirect request to api.YOUR_DOMAIN.com to port 8081 of the Artifactory
  # which exposes the REST API. Port 8082 on the other hand exposes the UI which is used in
  # the service above.
  proxy:
    image: alpine/socat:1.7.4.4
    restart: always
    expose:
      - 80
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "api.${DOMAIN?:}"
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "api.${DOMAIN?:}"
    command: ["tcp-listen:80,fork,reuseaddr", "tcp-connect:artifactory:8081"]

networks:
  default:
    name: nginx-proxy
    external: true
```

### Step 2: Create a `.env` file

```apache
# Domain that the application should be deployed to
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
DOMAIN=jfrog.example.com

# Unique and secret master key, can be generated with:
# openssl rand -hex 32
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
MASTER_KEY=d9fed922206468b77de4e0c74a0dda647c3aaff7c7e58335c93fc62ffbe90035

# Unique and secret join key, can be generated with:
# openssl rand -hex 32
JOIN_KEY=1a9278d6446e3cd1da0a144ef848bca46eaa984ebc781ffc09459a952f2dcf99
```

### Step 3: Start the application

::: info
The application needs some time to start up so don't worry if it is not directly available after you started it with the below command. You can still continue with Step 4.
:::

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Set volume permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R 1030:1030 ./artifactory
```

### Step 5: Complete setup

By default, the admin user is:

- Username: admin
- Password: password

Just login with the above credentials and you will be automatically prompted to complete the setup which also includes changing the admin password.

# Basic authentication

You might want to protect some applications that you deploy with the `nginx-proxy` using basic authentication (username + password) so that not everyone can access it. Nginx supports this out-of-the-box with a little bit of configuration.

## Step 1: Create `htpasswd` folder

```bash
mkdir htpasswd
```

## Step 2: Extend `docker-compose.yml` of nginx-proxy

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  nginx-proxy:
    # ...
    volumes:
      # ...
      - ./htpasswd:/etc/nginx/htpasswd

  # ...
```

## Step 3: Inside `htpasswd` create a file with the name of the domain that you want to protect

```bash
touch htpasswd/secret.example.com
```

## Step 4: Install `apache2-utils` to generate encrypted password

The created file requires an encrypted password in a specific format. Install `apache2-util` with

```bash
sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

## Step 5: Generate username:password

```bash
htpasswd -nb myUsername myPassword
```

Copy the generated command line output to the file created in [step 3](#step-3-inside-htpasswd-create-a-file-with-the-name-of-the-domain-that-you-want-to-protect) and safe it.

## Step 6: Restart nginx-proxy

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

When you now open the domain specified in [step 3](#step-3-inside-htpasswd-create-a-file-with-the-name-of-the-domain-that-you-want-to-protect), you will be prompted to enter your username and password.

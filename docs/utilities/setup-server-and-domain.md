# Setup linux server and domain

If you don't meet the prerequisites described on the [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started) page, you will find recommendations and instructions on how to order and setup a linux server and domain below.

## Setup your own linux server

### Order a VPS

You need a linux server for running the nginx-proxy. For servers located in Germany we recommend a Virtual Private Server (VPS) by netcup but you can use any linux server. They offer linux servers with following features:

- Starting from 2,99 € for 2 Cores, 2GB RAM and 40GB SSD
- RAID10
- DDoS Protection
- Hourly billing

You can checkout the prices on [their website](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/vps.php).

::: info Install Ubuntu
Netcup's servers are shipped with Debian Linux by default. We recommend installing the latest Ubuntu distribution before installing the nginx-proxy. To change the operating system login into their [server control panel](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de/SCP) and click on `Medien` in the nav bar. There you can choose between multiple images.

### Install Docker and docker-compose

You can install Docker and docker-compose with their official instructions:

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you want to speed up the installation you can use the following script which includes all official installation steps to install the latest versions:

#### **Step 1:** Create a `install-docker-ubuntu.sh` file

```bash
touch install-docker-ubuntu.sh
```

and add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script will install the latest version of docker and docker-compose for ubuntu.

# Install Docker for ubuntu
# According to: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Get latest docker-compose version
VERSION=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -Po '"tag_name": "\K.*\d')

# Install docker-compose
DESTINATION=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o $DESTINATION
sudo chmod +x $DESTINATION
```

#### **Step 2:** Execute the install script

```bash
bash ./install-docker-ubuntu.sh
```

## Setup a domain

You need to register / order a domain to use with the nginx-proxy, e.g. `example.com`. You can order your desired domain from any provider but you can order it together with your VPS [from netcup](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/domainangebote.php) for e.g. 5€ per year for a `.de` domain.

After you ordered your domain make sure to [setup your DNS records](/guide/getting-started.html#dns-records).

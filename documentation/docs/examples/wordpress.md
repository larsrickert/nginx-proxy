# WordPress

This example creates a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) website/blog.

::: info Make the example your own
In general you don't have to change anything in the below example to make it work for you. However, we highly recommend to take a closer look to the lines marked with a `TODO: CHANGE ME` comment.

- **Step 1:** Create a `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  db:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - ./data/db:/var/lib/mysql

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    restart: always
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: "${MYSQL_USER}"
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: "${MYSQL_PASSWORD}"
      VIRTUAL_HOST: "${DOMAIN}"
      LETSENCRYPT_HOST: "${DOMAIN}"
    depends_on:
      - db
    links:
      - db
    volumes:
      - ./data/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content
      # wordpress max upload size
      - ./uploads.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini

networks:
  default:
    name: nginx-proxy
    external: true
```

- **Step 2:** Create a `.env` file.

```apacheconf
MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somePassword
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
MYSQL_USER=wordpress
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
MYSQL_PASSWORD=somePassword

# Domain that the application should be deployed to
# TODO: CHANGE ME:
DOMAIN=blog.example.de
```

- **Step 3:** Create a `uploads.ini` file to increase file upload size.

The default upload size is very small (around 2 MB) so we want to increase it to allow bigger file/image uploads. Make sure that "client_max_body_size" in "proxy.conf" file of nginx-proxy is high enough for the below size. See [Step 5 of the nginx-proxy installation guide](/getting-started.html#installation) for the `proxy.conf`.

```apacheconf
# Change max upload size
# Make sure that "client_max_body_size" in "proxy.conf" of nginx-proxy is high enough for
# the below settings
upload_max_filesize = 64M
post_max_size = 64M
```

- **Step 4:** Start the application.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

When you directly open your domain after first running the above command, you may get a database connection error. In this case, just wait a few seconds and then try again. The database needs some time to initialize.
